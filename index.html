    <div id="intro">
    <p>For some children, simply having to go to school every day is hellish. They face anything from name-calling, geting threatened or even physical assault.
    In a recent survey, more than half of all 15-year-olds in England said they had experienced some form of bullying in the past few months.
    That means more children than not have been the victim of bullying.</p>
<br />
    <p>The possible consequences of bullying are severe. Bullied children are <i>twice as likely</i> to develop depression.
    Victims of bullying are also more likely to commit suicide. Cruelly, once a child has been the victim of bullying, they have
        a much bigger chance of being bullied again later in life. </p>

        <h2>Difference across regions</h2>
        <p>But the amount of bullying is not the same across England. In some local authorities, many more children are the victim of
    bullying than in others. There are several factors that determine whether an area is more prone to bullying:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Population density:</b> children in rural areas are bullied more often than those in cities.</li>
            <li><b>Crime rate:</b> in areas with more violent crime, bullying and violence are considered to be more normal.</li>
            <li><b>Income:</b> children in more affluent areas are more likely to be bullied than children in poorer regions.</li>
            <li><b>Quality of schools:</b> better schools are more capable of dealing with bullying.</li>
            <li><b>Diversity:</b> areas with more racial diversity have lower bullying rates.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Discover it yourself</h2>
        <p>Using the tool below, you can explore the effect these factors have in different places and discover how they play
            together to cause or prevent bullying. The differences in these factors can help explain the sometimes enormous
            differences between regions. For instance, compare the areas with the highest and lowest incidence of bullying,
            the <b>Isle of Wight</b> and <b>Camden</b>.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Camden doesn't perform better on every factor. The violent crime rate and the average income is higher
        than on the Isle of Wight. But due to a higher population density, a greater diversity and much better schools, the
        percentage of bullied children is much lower.</p>

        <p>Play around with our data and compare your region with others across the country. Select any two locations using the
        drop-down menu and press the reset button to start over.</p>
